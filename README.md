# bear-blog-theme-trove
A collection of themes built within the constraints of [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/).

## Purpose
I am building these themes to practice and familiarize myself with new CSS features. Some
may be unavailable to browsers but I'll do my best to _degrade those features gracefully_.

## How to Use:
1. login to your bearblog dashboard and navigate to theme page
2. copy the css of your desired theme from this repository and paste it to the theme editor
3. publish changes

## Mention
If you use my themes, you can choose to mention me or not in your About page or Colophon (would really appreciate though if you do :D).
